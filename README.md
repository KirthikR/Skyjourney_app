This design ensures that user input is seamlessly processed and routed through the system, with external APIs providing necessary data and services for flight information, analytics, and AI responses.

Technical Implementation

Frontend Development
Component Architecture:
Built using over 30 reusable React components, each organized by feature domain to promote modularity.
Components cover every part of the application, from UI elements to complex booking forms.
State Management:
Uses the React Context API to manage global state and provide consistent UI experiences across the application.
Local component states are managed independently for UI-specific interactions.
Styling Approach:
CSS Modules are utilized for component-specific styling, ensuring a consistent theme across the application.
Global styling variables are defined for ease of maintenance and future theme modifications.
Routing System:
React Router v6 is implemented with nested routes and programmatic navigation, ensuring intuitive and dynamic user experiences.
Form Handling:
Custom form components with built-in validation and error handling streamline the booking process and improve user interaction.
AI Integration Workflow
User Interaction:
Captures natural language queries and context from the current UI page.
Context Processing:
Maintains conversation history and user preferences to deliver context-aware responses.
API Communication:
Securely communicates with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API to fetch real-time suggestions and responses.
Response Handling:
Incorporates advanced error handling and fallback mechanisms for a smooth user experience.
UI Presentation:
Displays AI-generated responses with intuitive indicators (e.g., typing animations) to mimic natural conversation.
Analytics Implementation
User Journey Analysis:
Monitors the complete booking funnel—from flight search to payment—to identify user drop-off points and areas for improvement.
Feature Usage Metrics:
Tracks usage patterns to understand which features engage users the most.
Chatbot Interaction Analysis:
Analyzes common queries to refine AI responses and improve chatbot accuracy.
Session Recording:
Collects anonymous session data to gain insights into user behavior and enhance the overall UX.
A/B Testing:
Tests different UI variations to continuously optimize the user interface and user experience.
